Steps :

1) Vbox me kali Linux and Ubuntu ko import karlo
2) check if you have network tab in preferences as mentioned in lab manual

Agar vo hai to then follow the lab manual steps

Agar vo nahi hai to tools me jao...tools me NAT network ka tab hai ...usme add karo and then follow lab manual steps..

3) sck Test_file.txt <host>@ip isme error aayega mostly sabko...

If error is
ssh: connect to host 10.0.2.4 port 22: connection refused
scp: connection closed

Then probably the error is because of the ssh service is disabled in either of the OS...

So check on both terminals that if it's running or not by the command :

sudo systemctl status ssh

If on either of the PC it states that ssh.service could not be found then u need to install ssh server by the following command:

sudo apt install openssh-server

In my case ...Ubuntu me hua ye sab...
After these command Linux me vo file transfer ki command firse likho...and it will probably work ðŸ™ƒ
